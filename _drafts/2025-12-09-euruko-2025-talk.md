Here's a 30-minute walk through why modern AI development doesn't need agents managing agents managing agents. No complexity theater, no thousand-class frameworks, no vendor lock-in gymnastics.

Today, AI for most developers isn't about training models. It’s about building great products on top of APIs.
And that's exactly where Ruby shines.

Below is the full talk:

## Why I Built RubyLLM

After a decade in the Python AI world, I wanted the same thing I want in every Ruby app:

- **Simple things should be simple.**
- **Complex things should be possible.**
- Models and providers should be *commodities*, not rewrites.
- Conventions should carry you far.
- And you should be able to ship an AI feature with **one person, one machine, one API**.

In the talk I show:

- How RubyLLM gives you a single API for 11 providers and 620+ models
- Why you don't need “agent frameworks” to build real AI features
- Clean multimodality (images, audio, PDFs, video)
- Function calling, schemas, tools — without drowning in boilerplate
- Rails integration that gets you from zero → chat UI in under two minutes
- How to scale AI workloads using Async, Falcon, and fibers, not worker explosions

It’s the straight line through what the AI world turned into a maze.

## The Pitch

If AI development feels more complicated than it should be, it’s because most tooling optimizes for complexity — not clarity, portability, or speed.

RubyLLM takes the opposite stance: **one API to build with any model, switch instantly, move fast, and keep your app clean**.

Less ceremony. Less configuration. Less yak-shaving.
More shipping.

Thanks again to everyone at EuRuKo — this community is where the next generation of AI apps can *actually* be built.

Enjoy the talk, and let me know what you'd like to see next.
