There's something magical about when a party exceeds everyone's expectations. Last Saturday at [Beate Uwe](https://ra.co/events/2020543), [Floppy Disco](https://floppydisco.live) was one of those nights. Even the most seasoned players were taken aback by the atmosphere created by our incredible community - the dancefloor was packed from the very first half-hour, and the energy never dipped.

The night opened with a journey through Italian dance music heritage. Crimson Lake's (me!) set was a love letter to both Southern Italy and Berlin's dancefloors, bridging them through disco. From Alan Sorrenti's cosmic "Figli delle Stelle" to Sam Ruffillo's contemporary takes on Italo, the set showed how Italian producers have shaped and continue to shape dance music globally.

As the night progressed, each DJ built upon this foundation in their own unique way. Nonduality took us on a journey through classic house territory, weaving together gems like Martha Wash's "Carry On" and CeCe Peniston's "Finally '97" with contemporary cuts, keeping the groove deep and soulful. Jean Frais followed with a masterful blend of boogie and global disco sounds, from soulful boogie cuts to vibrant samba rhythms, taking the crowd on a journey around the world. Headliner Delfonic demonstrated why he's one of Berlin's most respected selectors, delivering a masterclass in jazz house that had the crowd mesmerized. Gabs Leyton maintained the night's energy with her funk-forward selections, before DJ Kodah took us home with his closing set.

What made the night truly special wasn't just the music - it was seeing Berlin's diverse crowd connect with these sounds, watching people from different corners of the world move together to both classics and new gems. The dancefloor became a meeting point of cultures, exactly what we've always envisioned Floppy Disco to be.

The success of this debut brings exciting news - *Floppy Disco will now be a bi-monthly resident at Beate Uwe*.

We're already looking forward to the next edition. Mark your calendars for December 29th - we've got something special brewing. Stay tuned for more details coming soon.

Thank you, Berlin, for making this night unforgettable. The disco never stops! ðŸ’«
