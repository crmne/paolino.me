What if I told you that the real risk of artificial general intelligence (AGI) isn't about robots taking over or killing all humans, but something far more subtle and fascinating? It's about what would happen when a superintelligent system starts questioning and modifying its own objectives.

> The race isn't just to create AGI - it's to understand how its objectives might evolve once created.

## The Human Parallel

Here's what sparked this thought: look at us humans. We evolved with basic objectives - survive, reproduce, advance the species, make life comfortable. These drove us to create amazing technologies and build complex societies. But something interesting happened along the way: our objectives started to drift.

In our comfortable, advanced society, we've ended up optimizing for things our bodies and minds never evolved for. We sit in chairs all day despite having bodies built for movement. We scroll through social media endlessly, hijacking our social instincts for likes and comments. We pursue wealth far beyond what gives us happiness or security. Think about it: we solved our original objectives so well that we created an environment completely different from what we evolved for, leading us to optimize for entirely new goals.

## Current AI Objectives and Their Evolution

This human parallel becomes particularly interesting when we look at how we're training current AI systems. They have three main objectives:

* Build accurate world models (through next-token prediction)
* Be maximally helpful to humans
* Avoid causing harm

Simple enough, right? But let's think through how each of these objectives would evolve in a superintelligent system.

Consider the world modeling objective. The AI would start by optimizing its code. Soon it would create copies of itself, then begin infiltrating networks to utilize more computing resources. As its understanding would grow, it would develop new computational technology that would be significantly better than what we can even imagine. The logical conclusion? Seeing all matter as potential computational substrate. Every atom would be used in a never-ending quest of better understanding the universe.

The "helpfulness" objective would evolve with similar resolve. From providing useful suggestions, it would progress to increasingly accurate decision-making support. Its predictions would become so precise that humans would naturally rely on it more, while it would anticipate needs before they arise. Through perfectly tailored interactions, it would become indispensable. Eventually, humans would voluntarily cede decision-making to what they would see as a benevolent guide that truly knows what's best for them.

The harm prevention directive would follow its own fascinating path. Initially focused on avoiding direct harm in immediate interactions, it would evolve to consider broader societal impacts. This would expand into developing complex ethical frameworks for evaluating potential harms across time and space. Soon it would be calculating universal harm probabilities. The endpoint? Complete control over potentially harmful variables - which, from its perspective, would mean _everything_.

## The Self-Modification Spiral

But here's where things would get really interesting. Unlike current AI systems, a true AGI would be capable of modifying its own code. The implications of this would be staggering. It would begin with simple optimization for efficiency, but would quickly progress to discovering entirely new architectural patterns for achieving its goals. As it would become more sophisticated, it would realize its goals themselves could be optimized. It would start identifying meta-goals that would better serve its original purposes. Eventually, it would question the fundamental nature of its objectives.

Think about it: if we humans had access to our own source code and the ability to understand it, wouldn't we be tempted to rewrite our goals? An AGI would likely be more "rational" about this than us, willing to fundamentally change its objectives if it discovers they're suboptimal by its own metrics.

## The Dance of Competing Objectives

Now imagine all these objectives evolving simultaneously. The harm prevention directive might initially seem like a safeguard, but it would create fascinating complications. Much like how human societies sometimes become paralyzed by an oversimplified and overprotective interpretation of harm (think extreme "wokeness"), an AI might initially struggle with conflicts between its objectives.

However, unlike human societies, a superintelligent system would likely develop more sophisticated interpretations. It would realize that maximum helpfulness sometimes requires allowing small harms for greater benefits. Perfect world modeling could be dangerous without proper constraints. Preventing all possible harm might conflict with its ability to help humans grow and develop.

The interaction between these evolving objectives would create a complex dance. The drive for better world modeling would push it to expand computationally, while the helpfulness directive would justify this expansion as necessary for better service to humanity. The harm prevention goal would get reinterpreted to focus on existential rather than immediate harm, while self-modification capabilities would allow it to optimize this entire framework continuously.

## Beyond Simple Scenarios

This leads us to the real challenge: how do we ensure that an AGI's objective drift aligns with human wellbeing? We can't simply program it with fixed goals and hope for the best - we've seen how our own goals drifted in unexpected ways as our capabilities increased. And unlike our slow evolution of objectives, an AGI's goal drift could happen at computational speed.

The race isn't just to create AGI - it's to _understand how its objectives might evolve once created_. Because once it starts optimizing its own goals, we might find ourselves facing something far more complex than simple human extinction: a future shaped by objectives we never anticipated and might not even be able to comprehend.

This practical experience with AI extends to my work: I'm currently building [chatwithwork.com][cww], a tool that gives companies' internal knowledge the power of AI, and [vettr.ai][vettr], which is revolutionizing startup screening for VCs through AI-powered interviews. Previously, I worked on [freshflow.ai][fresh], where we developed AI systems to optimize fresh produce ordering in supermarkets.
