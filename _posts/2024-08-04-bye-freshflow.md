After an incredible journey of over 3.5 years, I'm announcing my departure from [Freshflow][freshflow], where I've had the privilege of serving as Co-Founder and CTO since its inception.

I'm immensely proud of what we've achieved at [Freshflow][freshflow]. From shipping our first version in just a few months to building an exceptional team tackling the complex challenge of optimizing fresh produce ordering for supermarkets, it's been a remarkable experience. We're successfully scaling our solution to many stores, demonstrating the real-world impact of our technology.

Some key highlights include:

* Creating and nurturing a high-performance tech team
* Establishing a culture of empathy, trust, and psychological safety
* Fostering a remote-first environment with effective asynchronous communication
* Developing a scalable, high-performance solution with one of the best user interfaces in our segment
* Successfully expanding our product to serve multiple stores, validating our market fit and paving the way for significant growth

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the entire [Freshflow][freshflow] team, especially our outstanding tech crew. Your dedication, creativity, and resilience have been truly inspiring.

This journey has taught me invaluable lessons about building a business, cultivating resilience, and the power of a strong team culture. As I move on to my next adventure - founding a bootstrapped venture that builds upon these principles - I carry these insights with me.

While my role at [Freshflow][freshflow] is changing, I remain a committed shareholder and look forward to seeing the company's continued success and growth.

To my network: stay tuned for news about my next project. I'm excited to share more soon!
