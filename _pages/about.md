Hi, I'm Carmine Paolino. My journey with technology started early – at age 5, I wrote my first scripts to automate launching my favorite games. That moment of making a computer do exactly what I wanted felt like magic, and it sparked a lifelong fascination with technology.

These days, I'm building two AI tools I'm passionate about: [Chat with Work][chatwithwork], which helps teams unlock the knowledge buried in their workplace documents, and [Vettr][vettr], which is reimagining how VCs and founders connect. Previously, I co-founded [Freshflow][freshflow], where we used AI to help supermarkets reduce food waste.

My path in technology has been driven by curiosity. From becoming Vice President and Technical Officer of the Italian [Gentoo Linux][gentoo] community in my teens, to studying computer science at the [University of Bologna][unibo] where my work on large-scale social network analysis was published by [Springer][springer]. This led me to AI at the [Free University of Amsterdam][vu], where I had the chance to work with an alumnus of Geoffrey Hinton on combining deep learning with my love for music.

Over the years, I've been fortunate to work with amazing teams at [OLX][olx], [Capgemini][capgemini], and the [Alan Turing Institute][turing], always learning new ways to solve real-world problems at scale. Each experience has taught me something valuable about building technology that matters.

When I'm not coding or training models, you'll find me making house and disco music as [Crimson Lake][crimsonlake], running Berlin's [Floppy Disco][floppydisco] collective, or exploring the world through my [camera lens][pictures]. There's always something new to learn, build, or create – and for this, I'm very grateful.
